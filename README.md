## ðŸ©º Forecasting COVID-19 Trends in Ohio: An ARIMA Time Series Analysis

### Project Overview

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this project is focused on analyzing and predicting the virus's spread in Ohio using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models, a sophisticated time series analysis technique.

### Objectives
- **Data Compilation**: Collect and clean daily COVID-19 case data for Ohio to ensure it is ready for analysis.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Utilize ARIMA modeling to identify the best parameter combinations that accurately reflect the trends in the data.
- **Forecasting**: Generate forecasts that predict future trends in COVID-19 cases in Ohio, along with prediction intervals to aid public health planning.

### Key Outcomes
- Identified the optimal ARIMA model configuration for analyzing Ohio's COVID-19 case data.
- Produced forecasts of future case trends to assist in anticipation and planning.
- Enhanced understanding of time series forecasting and its application in public health analytics.

### Impact
This project underscores the importance of statistical models in managing pandemic responses. By forecasting COVID-19 trends, the project aims to support health officials and policymakers in making strategic and informed decisions.

### Contributions to Public Health
- The project's forecasts provide a foundation for proactive public health planning.
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of ARIMA models in processing and predicting trends from complex epidemiological data, paving the way for future advancements in health analytics.
